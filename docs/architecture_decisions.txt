1. gRPC is fast, so we will use it with Location Service to kafka as there is a lot of data being
transported from database to location service.
2. Kafka will receive data from location service, and send it to consumer. It will consume data and
send it to the database.
3. REST will interact with the Front End Application from Connection Service and Person Service.
